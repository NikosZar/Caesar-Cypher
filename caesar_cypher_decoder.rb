# frequency distribution of encrypted string
def freq_encrypted_message(string)

end

#Pseudocode
# Method that intakes the encrypted message (if message empty, return empty or error)
# Method analyzes the frequencies distribution of letters in the message
# Method determines the most likely shift value
# Method outputs the decrypted message
# Include appropriate error handling and input validation
#
# Hint:
# What mathematical operations could help measure the distance between two frequency distributions?
# How will I handle case-sensitivity? Non-alphabetic characters?
# How will I handle very short messages where frequency analysis might be less reliable
#
# Bonus:
# Adding confidence scoring to the decoder
# Implement multiple statistical methods and compare their effectiveness
